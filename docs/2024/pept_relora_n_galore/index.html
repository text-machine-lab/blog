<h2 id="intro">Parameter Efficient Pre-training (PEPT)</h2>

	<p>Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, but their massive parameter count creates challenges such as high computational cost and limited accessibility. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have addressed these problems by reducing the resources needed to fine-tune LLMs for specific tasks. This raises the question: can we use parameter-efficient training methods and achieve similar efficiency gains during the pre-training stage too?</p>
	<p>Parameter-efficient pre-training (PEPT) is an emerging area of research that explores techniques for pre-training LLMs with fewer parameters. PEPT has the potential to significantly reduce the computational cost associated with pre-training large language models. Multiple studies suggest that neural network training is either low-rank or has multiple phrases with initially high-rank and subsequent low-rank training (Aghajanyan et al., 2021, Arora et al., 2019, Frankle et al., 2019).</p>  
	<p>ReLoRA (Lialin et. al, 2023)  is the first parameter-efficient training method used to pre-train large language models. ReLoRA uses LoRA decomposition, merges and resets the values of the LoRA matrices multiple times during training, increasing the total rank of the update. Another recent advance in PEPT is GaLore (Zhao et. al, 2024). In GaLore, the gradient is projected into its lower rank form, updated using an optimizer, and projected back to its original shape, reducing the memory requirement for pre-training LLMs by a huge margin.</p>
	<p>This blog discusses ReLoRA and GaLore, explaining their core concepts, and key differences.

<h2 id="relora">ReLoRA: High-Rank Training Through Low-Rank Updates</h2>

	<p>ReLoRA uses LoRA (Hu et al., 2022) decomposition technique where the pre-trained model weights are frozen and trainable rank decomposition matrices (WA, WB) are injected into each layer of the LLM. However in LoRA, the rank of the matrix is restricted by the rank r (given below), and the new trainable parameters (WA and WB) are merged back to the original matrices only after the end of the training. </p>
	 <script type="math/tex">
        	r = \text{rank}(W_{A}W_{B})
    	</script>
	<p>To increase the total rank of the updates, ReLoRA uses the property of the rank of the sum of two matrices:  rank(A + B) ≤ rank(A) + rank(B). ReLoRA merges the LoRA matrices with the original matrices multiple times during training leading to the total rank of the update (delW).</p>
	<p>While ReLoRA's low-rank updates and merge-and-reinitialize approach offer efficiency gains and high-rank updates, there are a few challenges. Since the optimizer relies on ADAM, the updates are still highly correlated. ReLoRA performs a partial reset (>90%) of the optimizer state, focusing on pruning magnitudes. This helps break the correlation between updates and ensures the optimization process remains stable. However, this led to an exploding loss. A solution to this problem is to use a jagged learning rate scheduler where on every optimizer reset, the learning rate is set to zero and a quick (50-100 steps) learning rate warm-up is performed to bring it back to the cosine schedule (Fgure 1). This prevents the loss function from diverging significantly after the optimizer reset. Additionally, ReLoRA uses a warm start to gain better performance. In warm start, the model begins with a full-rank training phase for a portion of the training process (typically around 25%) before switching to the low-rank training phase. </p>

	<p>ReLoRA is described in Algorithm 1.</p>
	
<h2 id="galore">GaLore: Memory-Efficient LLM Training by Gradient Low-Rank Projection</h2>
	<p>GaLore is a memory-efficient pre-training technique gradients of the weight matrices are projected into low-rank form, updated using an optimizer, and projected back to the original gradient shape which is used to update the model weights. This technique is based on lemmas and theorems mentioned in the paper. The main lemma and theorem are described below.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Lemma: Gradient becomes low-rank during training</b><be /> 
			If the gradient is of form Gt = A - BWtC, with constant A and PSD matrices B and C, the G converges to rank-1 exponentially, suggesting that the gradient of the given form becomes low rank during training.</li>
		<li><b>Theorem: Gradient Form of reversible models</b><be />
			A reversible network with L2 objective has the gradient of form Gt = A - BWtC. The definition of reversible networks is mentioned in the paper. The paper proves that Feed Forward networks and softmax loss function are reversible networks thus having a gradient of the given form. The paper does not discuss if attention is a reversible network</li>
	</ul>
	<p>As LLMs are made of feed-forward networks and activation functions, based on the above lemma and theorem and its proof, it is implied that LLMs have a gradient of form Gt = A - BWtC and the gradient becomes low rank and training progresses.</p>
	<p>GaLore decomposes the gradient G’ into P, low-rank gradient G, and Q matrices using SVD. P is m x r, Q is r x n projection matrices, where r is the rank. At every step, either P or Q is used depending on if m <= n. G’ is updated using an optimizer (e.g. AdamW). The updated G’ is then projected back to the original space using the transpose of projection matrices P or Q. </p>
	<p>GaLore switches subspaces by reinitializing the projection matrices after a certain number of steps i.e. update frequency. The idea is the model learns in a subspace for a certain number of steps and then switches to another subspace using different initialization of the projection matrices. The projection matrices are re-initialized using the current gradient. Figure 2 shows a geometric interpretation of the low-rank subspace updates.</p>
	<p>The algorithm is given here: </p>

<p>The downstream tasks take a hit too. Here is what happens with BERT-base on GLUE when one outlier dimension is disabled at a time:</p>

<figure>
	<img src="/blog/assets/images/outliers-glue.png" /> 	
	<figcaption>Fig. 2. Performance of BERT-base on GLUE benchmark tasks with output LayerNorm dimensions disabled one at a time. X-axis: which dimensions are disabled. Y-axis: performance metric: loss (blue), accuracy (green), correlation coefficients (purple, orange). </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="is-this-a-bug-or-a-feature">Is this a bug or a feature?</h2>

<p>To begin this, the outlier dimensions do not seem to be an artifact of a particular model instance. We found such dimensions in all six models of BERT family that we considered: BERT-small, BERT-medium, BERT-base, BERT-large, mBERT and RoBERTa. They are also found in ELECTRA, XLNet, and BART. A similar phenomenon is present in the output dense layer of GPT-2, (since there the output component is not LayerNorm). It seems that this is a normal effect of pre-training in these models.</p>

<p>To find out when the outliers appear, we pre-train our own  BERT-medium model on BookCorpus <a class="citation" href="#ZhuKirosEtAl_2015_Aligning_Books_and_Movies_Towards_Story-Like_Visual_Explanations_by_Watching_Movies_and_Reading_Books">(Zhu et al., 2015)</a>. We started from a randomly initialized configuration with 8 layers and the hidden dimensionality of 512 units. We saved checkpoints of the model every 2000 steps, and we tracked the output LayerNorm weights across all of the model’s layers as the training progressed. Figure 3 shows that both scaling factors and biases begin to diverge from their initialization values quite early (after approximately 50k steps) in the training process. At roughly the same point, both training loss and evaluation perplexity begin to improve, which is in line with the drastic effect on model performance that we saw in the above pruning experiments.</p>

<figure>
	<img src="/blog/assets/images/outliers-pretraining.png" /> 	
	<figcaption>Fig. 3. BERT-medium pre-training on the BookCorpus dataset. (left) Evaluation perplexity (brown) and train loss (blue) as the training progresses. (middle) The changes in the scaling factors and the biases of the output normalization layer. Each line corresponds to one of the 512 dimensions. We highlight (in orange) the 417-th dimension, for which both the scaling factor and the bias fall out of the three sigma range at the end of pretraining. (right) Token embeddings computed for an input sequence that was randomly sampled from the data. Each line corresponds to one input token. The outlier embedding values are marked at the same 417-th dimension. All the plots are presented for the middle Transformer layer (4). </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="how-is-this-related-to-positional-embeddings">How is this related to positional embeddings?</h2>

<p>In a concurrent work, <a class="citation" href="#luo-etal-2021-positional">(Luo, Kulmizev, &amp; Mao, 2021)</a> hypothesized that the outlier phenomenon is attributable to the positional embedding layer. We argue <a class="citation" href="#kovaleva2021transformer">(Kovaleva, 2021)</a> it is much more likely that this effect comes from the LayerNorm component of the embedding layer.</p>

<p>The histogram in Fig 4. shows that it’s only the LayerNorm of the embedding layer that has unusual outlier values in the specified dimension. The distribution of weights in the other three components of the embedding layer – lexical, positional, and segment embeddings – is centered around zero and forms Gaussian-shaped curves with a small standard deviation.
Compared to the other components, LayerNorm weights have a much higher variance of values, with the highest weight matching the outlier position <tt>308</tt>. We hypothesize that the learned weights of LayerNorm in the embedding layer are responsible for producing high-magnitude outlier features that are propagated through the rest of the network resulting in the consistent outlier effects across the Transformer layers.</p>

<figure>

The blue histograms represent the entire set of extracted values within a given component, whereas the red ones refer to the weights that result in the outlier feature <tt>308</tt>. Most of the outlier-corresponding weights are centered around zero, while the LayerNorm weights fall out of the 3-𝜎 interval.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So… if BERT can be completely disrupted by disabling so few weights, how come this phenomenon hasn’t been seen in all the pruning studies so far? The catch is that it is not just about the weight magnitude. The outlier dimensions have to be pruned in the exact same position across the model, and neither magnitude pruning nor pruning attention heads based on their importance scores have that constraint. So, simply by not pruning the same positions across the model, the pruning studies have been avoiding the outlier iceberg. Just to avoid degenerate runs by chance, we would recommend that work on pruning/compressing Transformers explicitly puts in the constraint that the pruned weights should not be in the same position across the model.</p>

<p>Now that we know about the outliers, they are an obvious security risk: if a malicious actor gains access to the weights of a model, they could easily identify such weights and modify them (e.g. in a federated learning context). It would look like the model is still running as expected, except that its output would turn into garbage.</p>

<p>And, since the outlier dimensions seem to be a regular feature of Transformer-based models, this brings up a host of interesting questions for future work:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is it possible to pre-train a Transformer that wouldn’t have such outliers?</li>
  <li>If they are necessary, shall we save ourselves trouble and initialize the model that way?</li>
  <li>Can their emergence in pre-training be used as an auxiliary signal for when the model training is completed?</li>
  <li>Is 2-3 outlier features necessary sufficient, or will the model quality be improved by creating more of them?</li>
</ul>
